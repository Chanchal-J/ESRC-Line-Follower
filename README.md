# ESRC-Line-Follower
During this one month workshop, we learned about arduino language and about building basic projects like harmonium on a PCB or a Line follower robot. At the end of the workshop our robots competed where they had to trace a huge track with minimum errors. These are some codes that we tried, tested and implemented.
